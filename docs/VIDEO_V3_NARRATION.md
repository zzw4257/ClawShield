# VIDEO V3 NARRATION (English)

Target duration: ~88.8s at 30fps (`2664` frames).

## Scene 1 (0-300)
OpenClaw skills ship fast, but install-time trust checks are weak. Hidden remote execution and credential reads turn one command into a high-impact risk.

## Scene 2 (294-684)
ClawShield audits one repository commit, runs deterministic scoring, generates AI-readable guidance, then binds the outcome with fingerprint and report hash.

## Scene 3 (678-1248)
The Case Gallery shows three fixed inputs with three reproducible outputs: one green baseline and two policy-denied risk cases.

## Scene 4 (1242-1722)
For green outcomes, attestation on opBNB records score, fingerprint, report hash, repository, and commit in one verifiable event.

## Scene 5 (1716-2166)
AI contribution is explicit: prompts, outputs, diffs, and screenshots are linked so judges can inspect exactly what AI changed.

## Scene 6 (2160-2520)
Submission claims map one-to-one to artifacts: onchain proof, reproducible runs, AI build evidence, and a strict human-controlled trust boundary.

## Scene 7 (2514-2664)
ClawShield turns commit risk into a fast and auditable go or no-go decision before installation.
