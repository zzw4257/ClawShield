# VIDEO V2 NARRATION (English)

Target duration: ~88.8s at 30fps (`2664` frames).

## Scene 1 (0-300)
OpenClaw skills move fast, but trust checks usually happen too late. Attackers hide remote execution and credential reads behind normal install instructions.

## Scene 2 (300-684)
ClawShield takes one repo and one commit, then runs deterministic scoring, AI explanation, and commit-bound hashing. The output becomes a clear allow or deny policy decision.

## Scene 3 (684-1248)
The Case Gallery proves behavior with three concrete inputs: a clean baseline, a remote execution risk, and a credential access risk. Same pipeline, different verifiable outcomes.

## Scene 4 (1248-1722)
Only green outcomes can attest on opBNB testnet. The transaction event stores fingerprint, score, report hash, repo, and commit so judges can independently verify every field.

## Scene 5 (1722-2166)
AI contribution is not hand-waved. We keep prompt, output, code diff, and screenshot loops to show exactly where AI accelerated delivery and where human control stayed in place.

## Scene 6 (2166-2520)
Competition requirements map directly to artifacts: onchain proof, reproducible case runs, and AI evidence. What we claim in docs is exactly what the product and chain report.

## Scene 7 (2520-2664)
Result: faster shipping, with auditable trust boundaries before installation.
