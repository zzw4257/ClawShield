1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
OpenClaw skills ship fast, but install-time trust checks are weak. Hidden remote execution and
credential reads turn one command into a high-impact risk.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:22,800
ClawShield audits one repository commit, runs deterministic scoring, generates AI-readable
guidance, then binds the outcome with fingerprint and report hash.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:41,600
The Case Gallery shows three fixed inputs with three reproducible outputs: one green baseline
and two policy-denied risk cases.

4
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:57,400
For green outcomes, attestation on opBNB records score, fingerprint, report hash, repository,
and commit in one verifiable event.

5
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:12,200
AI contribution is explicit: prompts, outputs, diffs, and screenshots are linked so judges can
inspect exactly what AI changed.

6
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:24,000
Submission claims map one-to-one to artifacts: onchain proof, reproducible runs, AI build
evidence, and a strict human-controlled trust boundary.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,800
ClawShield turns commit risk into a fast and auditable go or no-go decision before
installation.
