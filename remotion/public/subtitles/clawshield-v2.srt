00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
OpenClaw skills move fast, but trust checks usually happen too late. Attackers hide remote execution and credential reads behind normal install instructions.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:22,800
ClawShield takes one repo and one commit, then runs deterministic scoring, AI explanation, and commit-bound hashing. The output becomes a clear allow or deny policy decision.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:41,600
The Case Gallery proves behavior with three concrete inputs: a clean baseline, a remote execution risk, and a credential access risk. Same pipeline, different verifiable outcomes.

4
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:57,400
Only green outcomes can attest on opBNB testnet. The transaction event stores fingerprint, score, report hash, repo, and commit so judges can independently verify every field.

5
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:12,200
AI contribution is not hand-waved. We keep prompt, output, code diff, and screenshot loops to show exactly where AI accelerated delivery and where human control stayed in place.

6
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:24,000
Competition requirements map directly to artifacts: onchain proof, reproducible case runs, and AI evidence. What we claim in docs is exactly what the product and chain report.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,800
Result: faster shipping, with auditable trust boundaries before installation.
