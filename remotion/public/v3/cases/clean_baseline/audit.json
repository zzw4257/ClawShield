The main risk is **false confidence** if:\n- the scan didn’t run, ran with limited rules, or failed silently,\n- only a subset of the code was analyzed,\n- dependencies/secrets/IaC weren’t checked.\n\n## Fix priorities\nSince there are **no reported issues**, prioritize **verification and coverage**:\n1. **Confirm scan completeness:** ensure the analyzer actually executed for this commit and covered the full repo (including tests, scripts, CI configs).\n2. **Add/verify baseline controls:** secret scanning, dependency (SCA) scanning, and SAST in CI on PRs.\n3. **Record evidence:** keep scan logs/artifacts tied to the commit SHA for auditability."
