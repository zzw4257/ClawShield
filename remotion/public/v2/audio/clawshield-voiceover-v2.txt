Scene 1. OpenClaw skills move fast, but trust checks usually happen too late. Attackers hide remote execution and credential reads behind normal install instructions.

Scene 2. ClawShield takes one repo and one commit, then runs deterministic scoring, AI explanation, and commit-bound hashing. The output becomes a clear allow or deny policy decision.

Scene 3. The Case Gallery proves behavior with three concrete inputs: a clean baseline, a remote execution risk, and a credential access risk. Same pipeline, different verifiable outcomes.

Scene 4. Only green outcomes can attest on opBNB testnet. The transaction event stores fingerprint, score, report hash, repo, and commit so judges can independently verify every field.

Scene 5. AI contribution is not hand-waved. We keep prompt, output, code diff, and screenshot loops to show exactly where AI accelerated delivery and where human control stayed in place.

Scene 6. Competition requirements map directly to artifacts: onchain proof, reproducible case runs, and AI evidence. What we claim in docs is exactly what the product and chain report.

Scene 7. Result: faster shipping, with auditable trust boundaries before installation.
