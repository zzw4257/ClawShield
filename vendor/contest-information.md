Good Vibes Only: OpenClaw Edition
Good Vibes Only: OpenClaw Edition is a fully online, AI-first vibe coding sprint where builders ship real products, prove execution onchain, and compete for a $100,000 prize pool.

OpenClaw is an open framework for building autonomous, AI-powered applications that can act, transact, and evolve onchain. This edition encourages builders to explore what’s possible when autonomy and onchain execution come together.

Open to builders, designers, founders, and idea starters—you don’t need to be an experienced engineer to take part. Community-nominated ideas become official prompts, and builders choose which ones to build.

If it runs, ships, and executes onchain, it counts.

Open to Builders and Idea Starters
You don’t need to be an experienced engineer to participate.

Builders, designers, founders, and product thinkers are all welcome. Community members can also nominate ideas they want to see built using AI on BNB Chain. This edition continues the build-in-public spirit of Good Vibes Only, allowing builders to choose which approved ideas they want to take on.

The best ideas often come from users who know exactly what’s missing in the ecosystem.

How It Works
OpenClaw Edition introduces updated submission requirements to ensure projects are easier to verify, reproduce, and evaluate fairly.

Tracks
Projects can be submitted under one of the following tracks, continuing the multi-track format introduced in earlier Good Vibes Only editions:

Projects can be submitted under one of the following tracks, continuing the multi-track format introduced in earlier Good Vibes Only editions:

1) Agent (AI Agent × Onchain Actions)
Build AI agents that don’t just write code—they execute onchain. Examples: security assistants, trading bots, treasury managers, and onchain ops automation.

2) DeFi
Practical DeFi tools: yield dashboards, strategy builders, risk monitors, liquidation alerts. Usable, reproducible—no token required.

3) Consumer
Mass-friendly onchain mini apps: games with onchain achievements, social check-ins, event tools, creator platforms. If a normal user can understand it in under a minute, you’re on the right track.

4) Builders
Tools that help other developers ship faster: scaffolding, monitoring, testing, security scanners. If it makes building on BNB Chain easier, we want to see it.

5) Open (No Restrictions)
Doesn’t fit the other tracks? Build it anyway. The only requirement is meeting the basic submission criteria.

The community can contribute ideas to the official BNB GitHub repository (follow the contribution format guidelines). The best ideas will be reviewed and approved by the BNB Chain team, and contributors will receive credit as the original proposer.

Prizes
OpenClaw Edition features a $100,000 total prize pool, distributed across 10 winners.

Selected projects will be showcased during a live finale and highlighted across the BNB Chain ecosystem.

Submission Requirements
To improve clarity and fairness in judging, OpenClaw Edition applies the following submission criteria:

Onchain proof required: Contract address or tx hash on BSC or opBNB
Must be reproducible: Demo link + repo, or clear reproduction instructions
No token launches during the event: No fundraising, liquidity opening, or airdrop-driven pumping until results are announced
Violations lead to disqualification.
AI encouraged, not required: Use any AI tools you want. Not using AI won’t affect eligibility.
If any (or all) of the above aren’t followed, it may result in disqualification and/or an invalid submission.

Judging
Final results in Good Vibes Only: OpenClaw Edition are decided through a balanced split between community signal and ecosystem expertise:

40% of the final score comes from community voting via Upvotes on DoraHacks
60% comes from judges with relevant ecosystem context
Community Voting (via Upvote on DoraHacks)
Community voting takes place on DoraHacks. Voters can simply go to the “BUIDLs” page, find the BUIDLs they support and click "Upvote" button. This helps ensure voting is transparent and based on informed participation.
